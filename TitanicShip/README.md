# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and other factors. The model is built using Python and several machine learning libraries.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used in many introductory data science and machine learning projects. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers based on features such as age, sex, class, etc. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Files

- `Titanic-dataset.csv`: The dataset containing information about Titanic passengers.
- `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.py`: The main script that preprocesses the data, trains the model, and evaluates its performance.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and how to run it.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
